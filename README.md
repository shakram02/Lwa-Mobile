LwA ( Lock with Authentication - mobile app )
======================================================
Forked from Google [Authenticator for Android (open source version)](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-android).

This project is an older fork of the one on the Play store. It's an older
version that doesn't get changes synced to it from the Play store version.

Description
-----------
This is an **immensely stripped** version of the original application. The only 
added functionality here is embedded QR code scanning.

The Google Authenticator project includes implementations of one-time passcode
generators for several mobile platforms. 

One-time passcodes are generated using open standards developed by
the [Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH)](http://www.openauthentication.org/)
(which is unrelated to [OAuth](http://oauth.net/)).

This implementation supports ~~the HMAC-Based One-time Password (HOTP) algorithm
specified in~~ [RFC 4226](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) and the Time-based
One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238).
